git push# Totally Debil Repository

Welcome to the most important repository in the history of human existence.

Here I solemnly declare that:

- I am completely, utterly, and undeniably debil.
- My code may or may not make sense.
- Any attempts at logic are purely coincidental.
- I accept all blame for any confusion caused by my presence here.

## Features
- ðŸ§  Brain capacity: minimal
- ðŸ’» Coding skills: questionable at best
- ðŸ¤¯ Common sense: non-existent
- ðŸ˜‚ Humor: occasional

Feel free to fork, stare, or cry in despair at the sheer magnitude of debility contained herein.# Ignore anything and everything
